\section*{Analysis contributions}

\begin{itemize}
\item Analysis contact for the mono-s(WW) semileptonic analysis (2020-present).
\item Editor and primary developer of the supporting documentation for the mono-s(WW) semileptonic paper (currently undergoing approval within ATLAS).
\item Contributed to control region studies and the evaluation of theoretical systematic uncertainties for the mono-s(WW) analysis in the fully hadronic channel.
\item Worked on the definition and optimization of analysis regions, evaluation of systematic uncertainties, and design of the statistical analysis framework for the mono-s(WW) semileptonic analysis.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Computing infrastructure contributions}
\begin{itemize}
\item Developed infrastructure to automate the creation and deployment of a kubernetes cluster as an ATLAS computing site using cloud computing infrastructure at the University of Victoria.
\item Implemented and tested tools for cluster resource monitoring and cluster. 
\end{itemize}

\section*{Analysis preservation contributions}

\item Analysis preservation contact person for all searches for new physics within ATLAS (Feb. 2020 to Oct. 2021).
\begin{itemize}
\item Provided technical assistance and liason to support analysis teams in the development of automated RECAST workflows.
\item Maintained central documentation of RECAST tools.
\item Reviewed RECAST workflows for completeness, and ensured centralized storage of workflows.
\item Organized hands-on training events within ATLAS for analysis preservation tools.
\end{itemize}
\item Contributed to workshop planning and ran tutorials on analysis preservation and related tools for numerous ATLAS workshops.
