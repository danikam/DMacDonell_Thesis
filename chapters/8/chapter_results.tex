\begin{itemize}
\item Present the background-only fit results (before/after yield plots and tables, pull plots and correlation plot for NPs) for validation.
\item Present validation plots (same as above) for a signal+bkg fit at a sample signal point.
\item Plot fitted signal strength and significance over the full signal grid (in the \ms vs. $m_{Z'}$ plane)
\item If no significant excess observed, plot observed limit overlaid on projected sensitivity in \ms vs. $m_{Z'}$ plane.
\end{itemize}
