\startchapter{Modelling the Dark Higgs Model and Standard Model Background Processes}
\label{chapter:mc}

\begin{itemize}
\item Generic introduction to the Monte Carlo method as a modeling technique.
\item Discuss of the application of Monte Carlo for modeling particle collision processes at the LHC. 
\item Present the concept of cross section and luminosity, and discuss the need to scale MC simulated data to the integrated LHC data luminosity. 
\item Broadly describe how the collected data can be compared with MC simulated signal and SM background processes to search for new physics.
\item Presentation of signal grid and simulation details (eg. leading Feynman diagrams, use of FullSim, inclusion of additional final-state jet, etc.).
\item Description of the background processes considered and why they make it into our analysis regions.
\begin{itemize}
\item Very brief description of how each background process is modelled (presumably don't need to get quite as in-depth as the description in section 6 of the support note).
