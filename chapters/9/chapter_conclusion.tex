The nature of dark matter remains one of the compelling open questions of modern physics.

A search for dark matter particles \(\chi\) production in association with a hypothetical scalar boson \(s\) decaying into a \(\Wplus \Wminus\) pair in the \(q\overline{q}'\ell\nu'\) final state is presented using \Lumi of \(pp\) collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of \(\sqrt{s} = \SI{13}{\tera\electronvolt}\), recorded with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. Candidate events are selected on the basis of missing transverse momentum recoiling against a system of jets and one lepton. The candidate Dark Higgs mass is reconstructed to search for events from \(s\to W W \to q\bar q' \ell \nu\) decays. Dominant background contributions from \wjets and \ttbar processes are estimated using dedicated CRs. A small 1.3\(\sigma\) excess of data is seen above the predicted yield of SM background processes in the \merged signal region, and a 0.8\(\sigma\) overprediction of the SM background processes compared with the data is seen in the \resolved signal region. Given the lack of a statistically significant excess in the signal regions, the Dark Higgs model is excluded for a range of masses of the Dark Higgs and Z' mediators of the model. The observed upper limits on \(\mu\) exclude Dark Higgs masses between 150 and 340 \GeV for \Zprime mediators with mass equal to 1 TeV as seen in \Fig{~\ref{fig:limits_srs_unblinded}}, similar to the expected upper limits, which exclude Dark Higgs masses between 140 and 360 \GeV for the same \Zprime mass. At a Dark Higgs mass of 170 \GeV, the observed upper limits on \(\mu\) exclude \Zprime masses up to 1850 \GeV, while the expected upper limit excludes \Zprime masses up to 2150 \GeV. The observed limits are weaker than the expected, particularly for low Dark Higgs masses in the range of 150 to 250 \GeV, owing to the small excess of data over the predicted SM background yield in the \merged signal region. The analysis in the semileptonic \(WW\) decay channel excludes Dark Higgs masses in the range of 150 to 340~\GeV, thus complementing and extending the range of the search for the Dark Higgs model in the fully hadronic \(VV\) decay channel.
