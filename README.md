HOW TO USE THIS TEMPLATE(updated by Caleb Miller, calebmiller@uvic.ca)

Orginal document distributed by University of Victoria Library, http://libguides.uvic.ca/uvicspace/etds/latextemplate

(1) "PhysicsThesis.pdf" contains useful knowledge on how to do basic latex as well as thesis structure

(2) Download and install the appropriate Latex package for Windows or Mac or Unix/Linux. I reccomend texstudio for windows users

(3) Use the appropriate Latex package to compile the thesis
template starting at the top (root) file in the top directory,
namely "PhysicsThesis.tex" in the folder "ThesisTemplate2017".

(4) I added a lot of custom packages and commands, take a look through macros/use_packages for how to use these

(5) macros/astro is astro specific commands and shortcuts

(6) If you discover a package is inferior or redundant let me know, also if you feel something else could be added let me know
